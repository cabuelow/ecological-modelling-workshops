## 'All models are wrong, but some are useful.'

![Photograph of Geoge E.P. Box, "one of the great statistical minds of the 20th century"](images/Box.jpeg)

In today's workshop we're going to learn how to model sea turtle populations so that we can predict how many there will be the future.

We'll use a mathematical model that, while relatively simple, has been incredibly useful.

#### How?

![Turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) required by law on shrimp harvesting boats since 1987](images/TED.png)

US law requiring TEDs in shrimp trawls was a direct result of population modelling published in this scientific paper:

#### Endangered sea turtles in Australia

Similar population models have been used to inform conservation of declining loggerhead sea turtle populations in Australia.

Find out more about [loggerheads in Queensland here](https://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/learn/animals/marine-turtles)

Let's imagine we were conservation managers of the loggerhead sea turtle population in Queensland back in the early 1990s. We had some monitoring data that suggests the population overall has been declining rapidly since the 1970s. What can we do to help it recover?

**Models help us predict the 'what if' so that we can make better decisions**

We can use models to help us predict what will happen under different conservation and management scenarios, in order to choose the best course of action.

#### **Break out group** - Loggerhead sea turtle populations

1.  What are some key aspects of loggerhead sea turtle life history? For example, at what age are they able to reproduce? How long can they live?
2.  What are the major life stages of loggerhead sea turtle populations?
3.  What are the major threats to loggerhead sea turtles, generally and/or in Queensland specifically?
4.  What are the different types of management actions that could help the population recover?

## Let's make a model

What is a model? The definition is actually quite broad - a model is [an informative representation of an object, person, or system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model)

### Conceptual model

**Christina to draw conceptual model of sea turtle population dynamics on the whiteboard**

**Question** - in the model we've just drawn, what is a variable and what is a parameter? What's the difference between the two?

### Mathematical model

We can use some simple maths to turn this conceptual model into a mathematical model to predict how many turtles there will be in the future based on the **initial conditions** (i.e., number of sea turtles in the population at time $t$) and model **parameters** (i.e., birth rate and death rate).

First we can turn the per capita birth rate and death rate into a per capita population growth rate called $r$. Following this, the change in turtle population size $N$ in each time-step $t+1$ will be,

$$N_{t+1} = rN_{t}$$ If $r$ is equal to 1, the population will be stable. If it's lower than 1, the population will decline. If it's greater than 1, it will increase.

#### Run the model in R

The initial population size ($N$) of loggerhead sea turtles is 1000 individuals and we want to know what it will be in 50 years. We've observed an annual decline in the overall population size of 8%, translating to an annual per capita growth rate ($r$) of $1-0.08 = 0.92$. Now that we've parameterised our mathematical model, we can use it to predict turtle population trends through time.

```{r}
# load the libraries we need
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling and visualisation 'meta' package

# make a function called 'predict_pop' 
# 'predict_pop' will predict population size through time, given the following initial conditions and parameters:
# init_size = initial population size
# r = per capita growth rate or the population
# t = time (number of time steps (years) to predict to)
predict_pop <- function(init_size, r, t){ # specify the function arguments
  out <- rep(NA, t) # create a vector the length of the number of time steps called 'out' that will store model outputs
  out[1] <- init_size # set population size in the first time step to the initial population size 
  for(i in 1:t){ # use a for loop to loop through each time-step and calculate population size at time t+1
    out[i+1] <- out[i]*r
  }
  return(data.frame(Time = 0:t, # return a dataframe with a column for the time-step
                    Population_size = out)) # and a column for the predicted population size
}

# make predictions
predictions <- predict_pop(init_size = 1000, r = 0.92, t = 50)
tail(predictions) # look at the last 6 years
```

Okay great, so we've got some predictions of sea turtle population size through time. In 50 years, our model predits there will only be \~ 15 turtles left from our initial population size of 1000.

Let's plot the trend.

```{r,fig.width=2.5,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(predictions) +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 'dashed', alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_classic()
```

**Bonus - can you try plotting different trends for different per capita growth rates (r)?**

### Assumptions and caveats

Modelling was once described to me as a **dark art**. It often requires a lot of assumptions, some of which may make the model unrealistic.

What assumptions are we making in our simple model of sea turtle population growth?

Remember, **‘All models are wrong, but some are useful’**

## Let's make a more useful model for conservation decision making

How can we make our model more realistic so that it is more useful for informing conservation?

We want to know how to use management to stop the population from declining. Should we focus our efforts on protecting hatchlings or on reducing bycatch of adults?

We can develop a slightly more complex model that assumes different age groups in the population will have different threats and therefore different per capita growth rates, allowing us to predict whether the overall population will increase or decrease if we implement management to protect different life stages (e.g., hatchlings vs. adults).

### Conceptual model

Let’s draw a more complex model of sea turtle life history with different life stages.

**Christina to draw conceptual model on the whiteboard**

### Mathematical 'matrix' model

To turn this into a mathematical model that we can make predictions with we can use a handy trick from linear algebra called *‘matrix multiplication'*.

In a nutshell, this trick allows us to multiply our stage-specific per-capita survival and population growth rates by the number of individuals in each life stage.

The mathematical equation for this model looks very similar to before,

$$N_{t+1} = AN_{t}$$

but now we have $A$ instead of $r$.

$A$ is a transition matrix defining the probability that individual turtles will either transition from one life stage to another, or whether they will remain in the same stage the following year.

Another slight change from our previous model is that $N$ represents a vector of number of individuals in the population in each life stage.

When we multiply the vector of the number of individuals by the matrix of growth and survival rates for transitioning between life stages, we get the predicted number of individuals in each life stage in the next year.

The math (i.e., matrix multiplication), works like this... **Christina to illustrate matrix multiplication on whiteboard**

#### Parameterising the model and making predictions

To predict the number of individuals in each life stage in the future, we need to parameterise the model with annual rates of growth, survival, and fecundity.

*How can we do that?*

Luckily, someone has already done this for us. We can use this table of demographic parameters for Loggerhead sea turtles for two different locations in Queensland: Heron Island and Mon Repos.

Here we'll just focus on the threatened population, Mon Repos.

![](images/transition-matrices.png)

The initial number of individuals in each life stage is: - Juveniles: 2000 - Subadults: 1800 - Sub-adult pubescents: 1500 - Adults: 1000

How many individuals do we predict will remain in each life stage in 50 years in Mon Repos?

```{r}
# make a function called 'predict_life_stage' to predict the number of individuals in each life stage into the future
predict_life_stage <- function(init_size, # initial population size
                               fecundity, # number of eggs per individual in the population
                               surv_juv, # juvenile survival probability
                               surv_sa, # sub-adult (pre-pubescent) survival probability
                               surv_sp, # sub-adult (pubescent) survival probability
                               surv_a, # adult survival probability
                               growth_juv_sa, # probability of juvenile growing into sub-adult (pre-pubescent)
                               growth_sa_sp, # probability of sub-adult (pre-pubescent) growing into sub-adult (pubescent)
                               growth_sp_a, # probability of sub-adult (pubescent) growing into an adult
                               t # prediction time in years
                               ){
  # create an empty transition matrix (A)
  trans_mat <- matrix(rep(0,16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4) 
  
  # populate the transition matrix with survival probabilities
  trans_mat[1,1] <- surv_juv
  trans_mat[1,4] <- fecundity
  trans_mat[2,1] <- growth_juv_sa
  trans_mat[2,2] <- surv_sa
  trans_mat[3,2] <- growth_sa_sp
  trans_mat[3,3] <- surv_sp
  trans_mat[4,3] <- growth_sp_a
  trans_mat[4,4] <- surv_a
  
  out <- list() # empty list for storing outputs from the model
  out[[1]] <- data.frame(Time = 0, 
                         Stage = c('Juvenile', 'Pre-pubscent', 'Pubescent', 'Adult'),
                         Population_size = init_size) # initialise list in year 0 with the initial population sizes in each life stage
  
  # use a for loop to make predictions in each time step
  for(i in 1:t){ 
    out[[i+1]] <- data.frame(Time = i, 
                             Stage = c('Juvenile', 'Pre-pubscent', 'Pubescent', 'Adult'), 
                             Population_size = trans_mat %*% out[[i]]$Population_size)}
  
  # return a dataframe of predictions and the transition matrix (A)
  return(list(do.call(rbind, out), trans_mat)) 
}

# make predictions
predictions <- predict_life_stage(init_size = c(2000, 1800, 1500, 1000),
                                  fecundity = 32.54,
                                  surv_juv = 0.816,
                                  surv_sa = 0.657,
                                  surv_sp = 0.717,
                                  surv_a = 0.782,
                                  growth_juv_sa = 0.012,
                                  growth_sa_sp = 0.056,
                                  growth_sp_a = 0.043,
                                  t = 50)
tail(predictions[[1]], 4) # look at the predictions for the last year for each of the 4 life stages
```

Our model predicts the population will be near extinction.

Let's plot the predicted change in the number of turtles in each life stage in 50 years.

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
predictions[[1]] |> 
  mutate(Stage = factor(Stage, levels = c('Juvenile', 'Pre-pubscent', 'Pubescent', 'Adult'))) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size, col = Stage) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

*Notice the rapid increase and then decrease in the Juvenile life stage. This is because the model has not yet reached a stable age distribution. Until it reaches a stable age distribution the population growth rate is not constant.*

*Try logging the y axis to see when the population reaches a stable age distribution (a log transformation makes an exponential function linear*

What about the population as a whole?

```{r,fig.width=2.5,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
predictions[[1]] |> 
  group_by(Time) |> 
  summarise(Population_size = sum(Population_size)) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = sum(filter(predictions[[1]], Time == 0)$Population_size), linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

What about adults?

```{r,fig.width=2.5,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
predictions[[1]] |> 
  filter(Stage == 'Adult') |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

## Scenarios to inform conservation decisions

So now we know that, given our estimates of sea turtle fecundity, survival, and growth in each life stage, we expect that in about 50 years time we will see near extinction of the sea turtle population at Mon Repos.

We can infer that directly from the transition matrix $A$ too, without making predictions. We'll use another handy trick from linear algebra. The dominant eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the transition matrix gives us the overall population growth rate - analogous to $r$ above.

```{r}
as.numeric(eigen(predictions[[2]])$values[1]) # get the dominant eigenvalue - this is the per capita population growth rate (r)
```

The population growth rate is less than 1, indicating the population overall is declining through time.

To put the entire population on a stable or increasing trajectory, should we protect hatchlings or adults?

To understand this, we can predict what will happen under different conservation scenarios: 1) Scenario 1: protect hatchlings 2) Scenario 2: protect adults

```{r}
# make predictions Scenario 1
predictions_1 <- predict_life_stage(init_size = c(2000, 1800, 1500, 1000),
                                  fecundity = 32.54,
                                  surv_juv = 0.95,
                                  surv_sa = 0.657,
                                  surv_sp = 0.717,
                                  surv_a = 0.782,
                                  growth_juv_sa = 0.012,
                                  growth_sa_sp = 0.056,
                                  growth_sp_a = 0.043,
                                  t = 50)
tail(predictions_1[[1]], 4)

# make predictions Scenario 2
predictions_2 <- predict_life_stage(init_size = c(2000, 1800, 1500, 1000),
                                  fecundity = 32.54,
                                  surv_juv = 0.816,
                                  surv_sa = 0.657,
                                  surv_sp = 0.717,
                                  surv_a = 0.95,
                                  growth_juv_sa = 0.012,
                                  growth_sa_sp = 0.056,
                                  growth_sp_a = 0.043,
                                  t = 50)
tail(predictions_2[[1]], 4)
```

Let's plot the overall population size under each scenario to see which will result in an increase over time.

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
all_predictions <- bind_rows(data.frame(predictions[[1]], Scenario = 'Baseline'),
                             data.frame(predictions_1[[1]], Scenario = 'Protect juveniles'),
                             data.frame(predictions_2[[1]], Scenario = 'Protect adults'))

all_predictions |> 
  group_by(Scenario, Time) |> 
  summarise(Population_size = sum(Population_size)) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size, col = Scenario) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = sum(c(2000, 1800, 1500, 1000)), linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

Our model tells us that protecting adults will result in an increasing sea turtle population in \~ 20 years.

We could also compare $\lambda$ across the scenarios to inform our decision on the best course of action.

```{r}
as.numeric(eigen(predictions[[2]])$values[1]) # baseline population growth rate
as.numeric(eigen(predictions_1[[2]])$values[1]) # protect juveniles population growth rate
as.numeric(eigen(predictions_2[[2]])$values[1]) # protect adults population growth rate
```

Protecting adults results in a per capita population growth rate \> 1, meaning that overall the population will increase over time.

The same model and predictions were used to demonstrate the importance of protecting sub-adult and adult loggerhead sea turtles to increase their population size. This resulted in turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) being a requirement in Queensland's prawn fisheries.

## Summary

Today we learned how to use some fairly simple models to inform conservation and management of threatened species.

We started with some conceptual models, added some maths and data to it, and voila, we’re making predictions about the future of sea turtles.

In reality, these types of simple mathematical models have been hugely important - eventually informing legislation to protect sea turtles.

Next week we’ll continue on our journey of learning the basics of ecological modelling. We’ll see what happens when we no longer assume the ecological relationships we’re modelling are deterministic, but rather that they are probabilistic due to natural variability.

Also, rather than use our models to predict the future, what if we want to estimate the effect of conservation that has occurred in the past?

That will be our focus for next week.
