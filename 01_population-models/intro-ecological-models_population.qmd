## 'All models are wrong, but some are useful.'

In today's workshop we're going to learn how to model sea turtle populations using a mathematical model that, while relatively simple in comparison to other modelling approaches, has been incredibly useful.

Legislation requiring TEDs in shrimp trawls was a direct result of the population modelling in this scientific paper

While this modelling paper informed US legislation to conserve endangered sea turtles, similar population models have been used to inform conservation of declining loggerhead sea turtle populations here in Australia.

Let's imagine we were conservation managers of the loggerhead sea turtle population in Queensland back in the early 1990s. We had some monitoring data that suggests the population overall has been declining since the 1970s. What can we do to help it recover?

We can use models to help us predict what will happen under different conservation scenarios, in order to choose the best course of action.

#### **Break out group (15 minutes)** - Loggerhead sea turtle populations

1. What are some key aspects of loggerhead sea turtle life history? For example, at what age are they able to reproduce? How long can they live?
2. What are the major life stages of loggerhead sea turtle populations?
3. What are the major threats to loggerhead sea turtles, generally and/or in Queensland specifically?
4. What are the different types of management actions that could help the population recover?

## Let's make a model

### Conceptual model

Turtles(t-1)  (moderated by, births rate, death rate) -\> Turtles(t)

**Question - in the model we've just drawn, what is a variable and what is a parameter? What's the difference between the two?**

### Mathematical model

We can use some simple maths to turn this conceptual model into a model that will predict how many turtles we will have in the future.

First we can turn the per capita birth rate and death rate into an per capita growth rate called $r$. Following this, the change in turtle population size $N$ over time $t$ will be,

$$N_{t+1} = rN_{t}$$
Let's say we know the initial population size ($N$) of loggerhead sea turtles is 1000 individuals. The annual per capita growth rate ($r$) is 0.9. In other words the population is declining at a rate of 10% per year. These values parameterise our mathematical population model. Now that it is parameterised, we can use it to predict turtle population trends through time.

```{r}
# make a function project population size using our mathematical model
predict_pop <- function(init_size, r, t){
  out <- rep(NA, t)
  out[1] <- init_size
  for(i in 1:t){
    out[i+1] <- out[i]*r
  }
  return(data.frame(Time = 0:t, 
                    Population_size = out))
}

# use the function to predict population size through time and store in a dataframe
predictions <- predict_pop(init_size = 1000, r = 0.9, t = 50)
tail(predictions)
```

Okay great, so we've got some predictions of sea turtle population size through time. In 50 years, there will only be approximately 5 individuals left.

Let's plot the trend.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(predictions) +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

**Bonus - can you try plotting different trends for different growth rates?**

### Assumptions and caveats

Modelling was once described to me as a **dark art**. It often requires a lot of assumptions, some of which may make the model unrealistic. 

What assumptions are we making in our simple model of sea turtle population growth?

- Closed system, no individuals entering or leaving
- Exponential growth, therefore no density dependence, e.g., competition
- Birth and death rates are the same for all individuals in the population

Remember, **‘All models are wrong, but some are useful’**

## Let's make a more useful model for conservation decision making

How can we make this more realistic in a way that will make the model more useful? We want to know how to use management to stop the population from declining….our different management actions would target different cohorts of the population,….for example we know a major cause of deaths is hatchling mortality, so we could focus actions that would support that, or we know that bycatch is another cause of mortality, so we could focus on that. How can we use this model to support the best decision?

We can develop a slightly more complex model that assumes different age groups in the population will have different threats and therefore different per capita growth rates, allowing us to predict whether the overall population will increase or decrease if we implement actions to protect different life stages

### Conceptual model
Let’s draw a model with different life stages….

What we really want to know if focussing management on different stages of the cause the overall population to be increase.

### Mathematical model

To turn this into a mathematical model that we can make predictions with we can use a handy trick from linear algebra called ‘matrix multiplication'. This allows us to multiply our stage specific population growth rates by the number of individuals in each stage.

The mathematical equation for this model looks very similar to before,

$$N_{t+1} = AN_{t}$$
but now we have $A$ instead of $r$. $A$ is a matrix of growth and survival rates defining whether individuals will either transition from one life stage to another, or whether they will remain in the same stage the following year.

Another slight change from our previous model is that $N$ represents a vector of number of inidividuals in the population in each life stage.

When we multiply the vector of the number of individuals by the matrix of growth and survival rates for transitioning between life stages, we get the predicted number of individuals in each life stage in the next year. 

The math (i.e., matrix multiplication), works like this...

#### Parameterising the model

To do this in real life, we would need to parameterise the model mortality and survival rates, how would we do that?

- Field studies
- Literature review

Luckily, someone has already done this for us. We can use this table of demographic parameters for the Loggerhead sea turtles in Heron Island. This is a pristine population that…

#### Making predictions

Similar to before, 

One really cool thing about this is that we can use something called an eigenvalue of the matrix to estimate the overall intrinsic rate of population growth, eigenvalue = exp(r), therefore to get r, we take the inverse of the exponent, which is a log. If r is 0, then the population is stable, if its greater than 0 its increasing, and vice versa.

Let’s see what are model predicts for the trend of this population through time.

Ok, now let’s see if we do some management that increases hatchling success. What about sub-adults, with turtle exclusion devices.

## Sensitivity analyses

Summary

So today we learned how to use some fairly simple models to inform conservation and management of threatened species.

We started with some conceptual models, added some maths and data to it, and voila, we’re making predictions about the future of sea turtles.

In reality, these types of simple models have been hugely important…eventually informing legislation that required TEDs, etc….

Next week we’ll continue on our journey of learning the basics of ecological modelling. We’ll see what happens when we know longer assume the ecological relationships we’re modelling are deterministic, but rather that they are probabilistic due to natural variability.

Also, rather than use our models to predict the future, what if we want to estimate the effect of management that has occurred in the past?

That will be our focus for next week.

Learning outcomes:

-              How to make a conceptual model and turn it into a mathematical model to make predictions

-              Difference between variable and parameter

-              How to parameterise models

-              How to use models to inform management

Key takeaways

-              Marine turtle populations are a major conservation concern… why?

-              In Australia…major threats are

o   – Heron island – protected group of turtles

o   Nesting females at Mon Repos – major rookery, nesting pop. Declining at % per year

-              Why or how could models help us conserve them?

-              Matrix models of population growth predict small declines in annual survival rates of adult and subadult loggerheads – profound impact on population dyamics

-              A loss of only a few hundred subadult and adult females each year could lead to extinction of the eastern Australian loggerheadsin less than a century

-              At Mon Repos, nesting female survival is apparently so low that even beach protection efforts resulting in 90% hatchling emergence success would not prevent population decline

**Week 6 – Ecological Modelling – Quantifying the effect of conservation**

Next week we’ll continue on our journey of learning the basics of ecological modelling. We’ll see what happens when we know longer assume the ecological relationships we’re modelling are deterministic, but rather that they are probabilistic due to natural variability.

Also, rather than use our models to predict the future, what if we want to estimate the effect of management that has occurred in the past?
