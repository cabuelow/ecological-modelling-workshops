## 'All models are wrong, but some are useful.'

![Photograph of Geoge E.P. Box, "one of the great statistical minds of the 20th century"](images/Box.jpeg) 

In today's workshop we're going to learn how to model sea turtle populations using a mathematical model that, while relatively simple in comparison to some modelling approaches, has been incredibly useful. 

![Turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) required by law on shrimp harvesting boats since 1987](images/TED.png)

US legislation requiring TEDs in shrimp trawls was a direct result of population modelling published in this scientific paper:

Similar population models have been used to inform conservation of declining loggerhead sea turtle populations here in Australia.

Let's imagine we were conservation managers of the loggerhead sea turtle population in Queensland back in the early 1990s. We had some monitoring data that suggests the population overall has been declining since the 1970s. What can we do to help it recover?

**Models help us predict the 'what if' this happened...**

We can use models to help us predict what will happen under different conservation and management scenarios, in order to choose the best course of action.

#### **Break out group (15 minutes)** - Loggerhead sea turtle populations

1. What are some key aspects of loggerhead sea turtle life history? For example, at what age are they able to reproduce? How long can they live?
2. What are the major life stages of loggerhead sea turtle populations?
3. What are the major threats to loggerhead sea turtles, generally and/or in Queensland specifically?
4. What are the different types of management actions that could help the population recover?

## Let's make a model

### Conceptual model

Turtles(t-1)  (moderated by, births rate, death rate) -\> Turtles(t)

**Question - in the model we've just drawn, what is a variable and what is a parameter? What's the difference between the two?**

### Mathematical model

We can use some simple maths to turn this conceptual model into a model that will predict how many turtles there will have in the future, based on the **initial conditions** (i.e., number of sea turtles in the population at time $t$) and model **parameters** (i.e., birth rate and death rate).

First we can turn the per capita birth rate and death rate into a per capita growth rate called $r$. Following this, the change in turtle population size $N$ over time $t$ will be,

$$N_{t+1} = rN_{t}$$
If $r$ is equal to 1, the population will be stable. If it's lower than 1, the population is declining. If it's greater than 1, it's increasing.

#### Run the model in R

Let's say we know the initial population size ($N$) of loggerhead sea turtles is 1000 individuals and we want to know what it will be in 50 years. We've observed an annual decline in the overall population size of 8%, translating to an annual per capita growth rate ($r$) of $1-0.08 = 0.92$. Now that we've parameterised our mathematical model, we can use it to predict turtle population trends through time.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# make a function project population size using our mathematical model
predict_pop <- function(init_size, r, t){
  out <- rep(NA, t)
  out[1] <- init_size
  for(i in 1:t){
    out[i+1] <- out[i]*r
  }
  return(data.frame(Time = 0:t, 
                    Population_size = out))
}

# use the function to predict population size through time and store in a dataframe
predictions <- predict_pop(init_size = 1000, r = 0.92, t = 50)
tail(predictions)
```

Okay great, so we've got some predictions of sea turtle population size through time. In 50 years, there will only be approximately 15 turtles left from our initial population size of 1000.

Let's plot the trend.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(predictions) +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

**Bonus - can you try plotting different trends for different per capita growth rates?**

### Assumptions and caveats

Modelling was once described to me as a **dark art**. It often requires a lot of assumptions, some of which may make the model unrealistic. 

What assumptions are we making in our simple model of sea turtle population growth?

- Closed system, no individuals entering or leaving
- Exponential growth, therefore no density dependence, e.g., competition
- Birth and death rates are the same for all individuals in the population
- etc.....

Remember, **‘All models are wrong, but some are useful’**

## Let's make a more useful model for conservation decision making

How can we make our model more realistic in a way that will make it more useful for informing conservation? 

We want to know how to use management to stop the population from declining. Should we focus our efforts on protecting hatchlings or on reducing bycatch of adults?

We can develop a slightly more complex model that assumes different age groups in the population will have different threats and therefore different per capita growth rates, allowing us to predict whether the overall population will increase or decrease if we implement management to protect different life stages (e.g., hatchlings vs. adults).

### Conceptual model

Let’s draw a more complex model of sea turtle life history with different life stages.
*Christina to draw conceptual model on the whiteboard*

### Mathematical 'matrix' model

To turn this into a mathematical model that we can make predictions with we can use a handy trick from linear algebra called *‘matrix multiplication'*. 

In a nutshell, this trick allows us to multiply our stage-specific per-capita survival and population growth rates by the number of individuals in each life stage.

The mathematical equation for this model looks very similar to before,

$$N_{t+1} = AN_{t}$$
but now we have $A$ instead of $r$. $A$ is a transition matrix defining the probability that individual turtles will either transition from one life stage to another, or whether they will remain in the same stage the following year.

Another slight change from our previous model is that $N$ represents a vector of number of individuals in the population in each life stage.

When we multiply the vector of the number of individuals by the matrix of growth and survival rates for transitioning between life stages, we get the predicted number of individuals in each life stage in the next year. 

The math (i.e., matrix multiplication), works like this...

#### Parameterising the model and making predictions

To predict the number of individuals in each life stage in the future, we need to parameterise the model with annual rates of growth, survival, and  mortality and survival rates, how would we do that?

- Field studies
- Literature review

Luckily, someone has already done this for us. We can use this table of demographic parameters for the Loggerhead sea turtles in Heron Island and Mon Repos in Queensland.

![](images/transition-matrices.png)

The initial number of individuals in each life stage is: 
- Juveniles: 10000
- Subadults: 4000
- Sub-adult pubescents: 2000
- Adults: 1000

How many individuals do we predict will remain in each life stage in 50 years?

```{r}
predict_life_stage <- function(init_size, 
                               fecundity, 
                               surv_juv,
                               surv_sa,
                               surv_sp,
                               surv_a,
                               growth_juv_sa,
                               growth_sa_sp,
                               growth_sp_a,
                               t){
  trans_mat <- matrix(rep(0,16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4) # matrix of 0s
  trans_mat[1,1] <- surv_juv
  trans_mat[1,4] <- fecundity
  trans_mat[2,1] <- growth_juv_sa
  trans_mat[2,2] <- surv_sa
  trans_mat[3,2] <- growth_sa_sp
  trans_mat[3,3] <- surv_sp
  trans_mat[4,3] <- growth_sp_a
  trans_mat[4,4] <- surv_a
  
  out <- list()
  out[[1]] <- data.frame(Time = 0, Stage = c('Juvenile', 'Pre-pubscent', 'Subadult', 'Adult'), Population_size = init_size)
  for(i in 1:t){
    out[[i+1]] <- data.frame(Time = i, Stage = c('Juvenile', 'Pre-pubscent', 'Subadult', 'Adult'), Population_size = trans_mat %*% out[[i]]$Population_size)}
  return(list(do.call(rbind, out),trans_mat))
}

predictions <- predict_life_stage(init_size = c(1000, 10, 2000, 1000),
                                  fecundity = 32.54,
                                  surv_juv = 0.816,
                                  surv_sa = 0.657,
                                  surv_sp = 0.717,
                                  surv_a = 0.782,
                                  growth_juv_sa = 0.012,
                                  growth_sa_sp = 0.056,
                                  growth_sp_a = 0.043,
                                  t = 100)
tail(predictions[[1]], 4)
```

Let's plot the predicted change in the number of turtles in each life stage.

```{r}
predictions[[1]] |> 
  mutate(Stage = factor(Stage, levels = c('Juvenile', 'Pre-pubscent', 'Subadult', 'Adult'))) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size, col = Stage) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

What about the population as a whole?

```{r}
predictions[[1]] |> 
  group_by(Time) |> 
  summarise(Population_size = sum(Population_size)) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = sum(filter(predictions[[1]], Time == 0)$Population_size), linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

What about adults?

```{r}
predictions[[1]] |> 
  filter(Stage == 'Adult') |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Time, y = Population_size) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()
```

## Sensitivity analyses to inform conservation decisions

So now we know that, given our estimates of sea turtle fecundity, survival, and growth in each life stage, we expect that in about 50 years time we will see overall population decline that will continue into the future. 

We can infer that directly from the transition matrix $A$ too, without making predictions. The dominant eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the transition matrix gives us the overall population growth rate - analogous to $r$ above. 

```{r}
eigen(predictions[[2]])$values[1] # get the dominant eigenvalue - this is the per capita population growth rate (r)
```

The population growth rate is less than 1, indicating the population overall is declining through time.

## Summary

So today we learned how to use some fairly simple models to inform conservation and management of threatened species.

We started with some conceptual models, added some maths and data to it, and voila, we’re making predictions about the future of sea turtles.

In reality, these types of simple models have been hugely important…eventually informing legislation that required TEDs, etc….

Next week we’ll continue on our journey of learning the basics of ecological modelling. We’ll see what happens when we know longer assume the ecological relationships we’re modelling are deterministic, but rather that they are probabilistic due to natural variability.

Also, rather than use our models to predict the future, what if we want to estimate the effect of management that has occurred in the past?

That will be our focus for next week.
