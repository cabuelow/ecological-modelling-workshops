## Introduction to ecological models using R

This repository contains data and code for two practical workshops introducing ecological modelling for conservation using the R programming software.

### Workshop 1 - Modelling to inform conservation of an endangered species

We will learn how mathematical models can help save threatened marine species, like the loggerhead sea turtle. {tidyverse} is required:
`install.packages(‘tidyverse’)`

### Workshop 2 - Estimating conservation impacts with statistical models

We’ll learn how models can help us quantify the effectiveness of marine conservation: how many more fish species do we have because of marine protected areas in New South Wales? The following R packages are required:
`install.packages(c(‘dagitty’, ‘ggdag’, ‘sf’, ‘tmap’, ‘wdpar’, ‘lme4’))`
