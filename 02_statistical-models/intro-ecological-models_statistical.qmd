## Quantifying conservation effectiveness

Marine protected areas are an important tool for conserving species. In contrast to last week's workshop where we used a mathematical model to predict the future for endangered sea turtles, we'll look to the past and use models to quantify the effect that conservation has had on fish diversity.

### Have marine protected areas in New South Wales increased reef fish diversity, as we would expect?

There are a lot of different things that could influence fish diversity on reefs. A [recent paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718316525) has highlighted the challenges of isolating the impact of MPAs in the Great Barrier Reef.

![Theory of change for MPAs in the GBR - Fraser et al. 2019](images/toc.png)

Given all of the potential confounders, how can we isolate the effect of MPAs?

Here we'll combine a graphical modelling technique with a statistical model to isolate the effect of MPAs on observed diversity of reef fishes.

## Structural (graphical) causal model

Structural causal models are graphical depictions of 'cause-and-effect' relationships in our system of interest which, in this case, is reef fish communities and marine protected areas (MPAs). Technically, these are called 'Directed Acyclic Graphs' (DAGs). **Acyclic** means we can't have any bi-directional relationships.

### Draw the DAG

The relationship we're interested in estimating is the causal effect of MPAs on reef fish species diversity. Let's draw a DAG for it.

```{r,fig.width=3,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dagitty) 
library(ggdag)

# DAG of cause and effect relationship between MPAs and reef fish diversity
dag <- dagify(diversity ~ MPA,
              exposure = 'MPA',
              outcome = 'diversity')

# plot it
ggdag(dag, layout = "circle", text_size = 2) + theme_dag_blank()
```

What else might influence both the presence of MPAs and fish diversity? Let's add them to the DAG.

```{r}
# further develop the DAG
dag <- dagify(diversity ~ MPA, 
              diversity ~ MPA_dist, 
              diversity ~ latitude, 
              diversity ~ Port_dist, 
              diversity ~ depth, 
              diversity ~ fishing, 
              diversity ~ habitat, 
              fishing ~ MPA, 
              fishing ~ Port_dist, 
              MPA ~ Port_dist, 
              habitat ~ depth, 
              habitat ~ latitude, 
              fishing ~ MPA_dist, 
              MPA ~ depth, 
              MPA ~ habitat, 
              fishing ~ habitat, 
              fishing ~ depth, 
              exposure = 'MPA', 
              outcome = 'diversity')

# plot it
ggdag(dag, layout = "circle", text_size = 2) + theme_dag_blank()
```

### Find confounders to adjust for

Apply 'do-calculus' to the DAG to identify confounders that need to be adjusted for to estimate the causal effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity.

```{r}
ggdag_adjustment_set(dag, text_size = 2) + theme_dag_blank()
```

This says that habitat type, depth and distance to ports are confounders we need to adjust for in our **statistical regression model** that we use to estimate the effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity.

Statistical regression models allow us to quantify relationships between variables of interest, such as MPAs and reef fish diversity, assuming that all other variables (i.e., the confounders) are held constant.

Before we can run the statistical model though, we need to get some data (or we could simulate it first, which is best practice, but that's beyond the scope of this course).

## Data for our statistical model

To estimate the effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity we need data on the following:

1.  MPAs in New South Wales (our exposure variable of interest)
2.  Reef fish diversity inside and outside of MPAs in New South Wales (our outcome variable of interest)
3.  Distance to ports from each of our reef fish diversity observations
4.  Habitat type of each our reef fish diversity observations
5.  Depth of each of our reef fish diversity observations.

### Marine protected areas (MPAs) in New South Wales

Here we use the [wdpar](https://prioritizr.github.io/wdpar/index.html) package to fetch and clean MPA spatial data in Australia.

```{r}
# load libraries
library(wdpar)
library(sf) 
library(tmap)

# get protected area data
#pa_aus <- wdpa_fetch("Australia", wait = TRUE, download_dir = rappdirs::user_data_dir("wdpar")) 
#mpa_aus <- pa_aus |>  
  # filter out terrestrial mpas filter
 # filter(MARINE != "0") |> 
  # clean data 
  #wdpa_clean() 
#st_write(mpa_aus, 'data/mpa_aus.gpkg')
mpa_aus <- st_read('data/mpa_aus.gpkg')

# map it
sf_use_s2(FALSE) # turn off s2 to avoid issues with mapping invalid geometries 
tmap_mode('view') 
mpa_aus |> qtm(fill = 'NO_TAKE')
```

### Fish diversity in New South Wales

Now we need our outcome of interest - reef fish diversity in New South Wales. I've downloaded this from the [Reef Life Survey](https://reeflifesurvey.com/), so we'll just read it in here.

```{r}
# read in fish data
fish_dat <- read.csv('data/rls_surveydata.csv') |>  
  filter(indicator == 'Fish Species' & location != 'Cape Howe') # whoops, exclude Cape Howe, it is on the NSW-Victoria border
head(fish_dat) 
```

This looks good. But ideally we want this as a spatially referenced dataframe so that we identify which reef fish diversity observations are inside or outside of MPAs.

Its easy to turn a normal dataframe into a spatial dataframe in R

```{r}
# turn into a spatial dataframe 
fish_dat_sf <- fish_dat |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'), crs = 4326) |>  
  st_transform(st_crs(mpa_aus)) 

# map the reef fish observations
qtm(fish_dat_sf)
```

Now let's do some spatial data wrangling to add a column to our reef fish observations identifying whether they are in MPAs or not - this is a variable we need to include in our statistical model.

```{r}
# keep PAs that intersect with fish data
mpa_nsw <- st_join(mpa_aus, fish_dat_sf, left = F) |> 
  select(WDPAID:geom) |> 
  group_by(WDPAID, NAME) |>  
  summarise() 

# join MPA info to fish survey data
fish_dat_mpa <- fish_dat_sf |>  
  st_join(filter(mpa_aus, WDPAID %in% mpa_nsw$WDPAID))

# colour fish survey points whether in an mpa or not
qtm(mpa_nsw) + qtm(fish_dat_mpa, dots.col = 'PA_DEF') 

# how many? 
nrow(filter(fish_dat_mpa, PA_DEF == 'PA'))/nrow(fish_dat_mpa)
```

### Data on counfounders

I used Google Earth to get spatial coordinates of Port locations in New South Wales. We'll use this to estimate the shortest distance between each reef fish observation to a Port.

```{r}
# turn port data into a spatial data frame
port_dat <- read.csv('data/nsw-ports.csv') |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c('long', 'lat'), crs = 4326) |>  # turn ports into a spatial dataframe
  st_transform(st_crs(mpa_nsw)) # transform to the same coordinate reference system as the mpa data

# map it
qtm(port_dat) + qtm(fish_dat_mpa, dots.col = 'cyan')
```

Looks good, now some more spatial data wrangling to estimate shortest distance to ports.

```{r}
# get shortest distance of each survey point to a port
port_dist <- fish_dat_mpa |> 
  st_distance(port_dat) 
colnames(port_dist) <- port_dat$name 
port_dist2 <- data.frame(st_drop_geometry(fish_dat_mpa), units::drop_units(port_dist)) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Yamba:Eden), names_to = 'Port_name', values_to = 'Port_distance_m') |> 
  group_by(survey.id) |> 
  summarise(Port_distance_m = min(Port_distance_m))

# join to master dataframe
fish_dat_mpa <- fish_dat_mpa |> 
  left_join(port_dist2) 
head(fish_dat_mpa)
```

Last but not least, we need spatial data on habitat type and depth for each reef fish observation. I was able download those from the [Australian Ocean Data Network](https://portal.aodn.org.au/)

```{r}
# read in habitat and depth spatial data
habitat_dat <- st_read('data/Seabed_habitat_New_South_Wales_State_Waters/SeamapAus_NSW_seabed_habitat_statewide_2013Polygon.shp') |> 
  st_transform(st_crs(mpa_nsw)) # transform to the same coordinate reference system as mpa data

# spatial join to identify habitat type and depth at each reef fish observation
fish_dat_mpa <- fish_dat_mpa |> 
  st_join(habitat_dat) 
head(fish_dat_mpa) 

# assign anything with NAs as non-reef and 0 - 20m depth
fish_dat_mpa <- fish_dat_mpa |> 
  mutate(Habitat = ifelse(is.na(Habitat), 'Non-Reef', Habitat), Depth = ifelse(is.na(Depth), '0 - 20m', Depth)) 

# save our master dataframe
#write.csv(st_drop_geometry(fish_dat_mpa), 'data/master-data.csv', row.names = F)
```

Phew, that was a lot of work! Finding, cleaning, and wrangling data often takes the most time when performing data analyses.

## Statistical model to isolate and quantify the effect of MPAs

Now that we've prepared our master dataframe with our outcome, exposure, and confounder variables, we're ready to use a statistical regression model to quantify the causal effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity.

First, let's have a look at a summary of the data

```{r}
# load libraries
library(lme4)

# fit statistical model to estimate causal effect of MPA on fish diversity
dat <- read.csv('data/master-data.csv') |> 
  mutate(MPA_present = factor(ifelse(is.na(PA_DEF), 0, 1)), 
         Habitat_Depth = factor(ifelse(is.na(Label), 'Non Reef 0 - 20m', Label)), # dummy code binary variables 
         site.code = factor(site.code), 
         fish_diversity = value, 
         Port_distance_m = Port_distance_m/(2*sd(Port_distance_m))) # make categorical variables factors and standardise continuous variables
summary(dat)
```

And have a look at the raw data

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(dat) + 
  aes(x = MPA_present, y = fish_diversity, col = MPA_present) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) + 
  theme_classic()
```

So the raw data suggest fish diversity observations are similar inside and outside of MPAs in New South Wales. But what if we adjust for biases due to other variables that might be influencing diversity at these locations?

A statistical regression model can do this for us. But, before we try to fit one to our data, let's review the basics of general linear models (**note the term 'general' is important here - there is also another class of regression called 'generalised' linear models, which we'll get to later**).

### Linear models

We can use linear models to estimate the strength and direction of ecological relationships. We want to estimate the relationship between MPA presence and reef fish biodiversity, while adjusting for confounders.

The word 'linear' is important - when we use linear models we assume a straight (or linear) relationship between our **outcome** (i.e., fish diversity) and our **exposure and confounding covariates** (i.e., MPA presence, distance to port, habitat type, and depth).

In addition to linearity, there are three other assumptions of linear regression model: homoskedasticity (constant variance) and normality of the residuals, and independence of observations.

**Exposure and confounding covariates** can be either *continuous* (left plot below) or *categorical* (right plot below). In our case we have both, e.g., MPA presence is categorical while distance to port is continuous.

```{r, fig.width=5.5,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
b0 <- 2
b1 <- -3
e_mu <- 0
e_sd <- 1
X <- rnorm(20)
X2 <- rep(c(0,1), 10)
e <- rnorm(length(X), e_mu, e_sd)
y <- b0 + b1*X + e
y2 <- b0 + b1*X2 + e
df <- data.frame(X, X2, y, y2)

a <- ggplot(df) +
  aes(x = X, y = y) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle('A) Continuous') +
  ylab('Outcome (y)') +
  xlab('Covariate (x)') +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  theme_classic()

b <- ggplot(df) +
  aes(x = factor(X2), y = y2) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle('B) Categorical') +
  ylab('Outcome (y)') +
  xlab('Covariate (x)') +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  theme_classic()
a+b
```

Although general linear models assume a linear relationship between the response and explanatory variable, **they can accommodate non-linearity** via a non-linear transformation of the explanatory variable. For example, this quadratic relationship between the explanatory and response.

```{r, fig.width=2.5,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)
b0 <- 2
b1 <- -3
e_mu <- 0
e_sd <- 1
X <- rnorm(20)
e <- rnorm(length(X), e_mu, e_sd)
y <- b0 + b1*X^2 + e
df <- data.frame(X, y)

ggplot(df) +
  aes(x = X, y = y) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle('C) Non-linear (quadratic)') +
  ylab('Outcome (y)') +
  xlab('Covariate (x)') +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  theme_classic()
```

#### A little bit of maths

To understand how they work, it helps to take a quick look at how we formulate linear models mathematically:

$$y_i = b_0 + b_{1}X_{1i} + \epsilon_i,$$

-   $y$ is our outcome variable of interest (i.e., reef fish diversity),

-   $b_0$ is the is the **y-intercept** for the linear relationship between $y$ and our explanatory variables ($X$'s) - which is the average value of $y$ when $X$ is equal to 0,

-   $b_1$ is the coefficient representing the strength and direction of the relationship between $y$ and $X_{1}$ (the **slope**) - which can be interpreted as the average change in $y$ in response to a one unit shift in $X$,

-   $X_{1}$ is the exposure variable of interest (i.e., MPA presence) and,

-   $\epsilon$ is the random, unexplained error in our observations around the fitted relationship(s) between $y$ and $X$(s).

We'll often refer to $\epsilon$ as the **residual error**. It is this residual error term that makes our model a 'statistical' one rather than a purely mathematical (deterministic) one.

In the above example we only have one covariate, our exposure variable ($X_{1}$; MPA presence). We will also need to include additional terms for each of our confounder variaables that we wish to adjust for; e.g. $b_{2}X_{2i}$. When we add more than one covariate to the right hand side of the equation, the interpretation of the beta coefficients (slopes) becomes 'the average change in $y$ in response to a one unit shift in $X$, *holding all other covariates constant*'. This is the beauty and power of multiple linear regression, we can evaluate the effect of each covariate in isolation from others.

When we're fitting **general** linear models, we assume that $\epsilon$, the error term, is drawn from a normal (i.e., gaussian) probability distribution. We can write that assumption mathematically as,

$$\epsilon \sim Normal(0, \sigma)$$ where the mean is 0 and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

What does a normal probability distribution look like? We can draw some random numbers from a normal distribution and plot them up. We noted above that the normal distribution has two parameters, the mean ($\mu$) and the standard deviation ($\sigma$).

```{r,fig.width=3,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
# draw a vector of 1000 random numbers from a normal probability distribution
random_numbers <- data.frame(normal_random_numbers = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 2))

# plot a histogram of the distribution of normally distributed random numbers
random_numbers |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = normal_random_numbers) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic()
```

So, just as we would expect, the mean is around 0. What happens if you change the mean or increase the standard deviation?

When our outcome or interest ($y$) is continuous and unbounded (i.e., could potentially be any number between $-∞$ and $∞$), assuming that $\epsilon$ (our residual error) is normally distributed makes sense.

Reef fish diversity, our $y$, is not continuous (we can't have half a species, only whole integers) and can't be negative (\< 0). It is a discrete variable bounded to only positive numbers (0 to $∞$). So by assuming that the residual error of a linear regression fitted to reef fish diversity will be normally distributed will result in a mis-specified model. To fit a correctly specified model, we'll need to use a *generalised linear model*.

But first, let's fit the mis-specified model that incorrectly assumes normally distributed errors and see how we can diagnose problems with the fit of our model.

### Fitting a mis-specified model

So, to re-cap, here is the statistical regression model we want to fit to estimate,

$$y_i = b_0 + b_{1}X_{mpa,i} + b_{2}X_{port{dist},i} + b_{3}X_{hab{depth},i} + \epsilon_i,$$ $$\epsilon \sim Normal(0, \sigma)$$ where $y$ is reef fish diversity, $i$ is an index of observations, $b_0$ is the intercept of average reef fish diversity, $b_{1,2,3}$ are slope coefficients for each of the covariates $X_{mpa, portdist, habdepth}$ and $\epsilon$ is the residual, unexplained error in our model.

The syntax for fitting this model in R is similar to the mathematical equation we've specified above. Note however that I've also included an additional group-level random effect term for site. Random effects is beyond the scope of this course; all you need to know for now is that this random intercept term for sites allows us to avoid violating the assumption that our reef fish diversity observations are independent (essentially the additional term is accounting for the fact that diversity observations within a site or more likely to be similar to each other than other observations).

Ok, lets fit the model

```{r}
# load libraries
library(lme4)
# fit model
mod <- lmer(fish_diversity ~ MPA_present + Port_distance_m + Habitat_Depth + (1|site.code), data = dat) 
# look at a summary
summary(mod)
```

Before we go ahead and try interpreting the effect size estimates (i.e., the strength and direction of the relationship between our exposure (MPA presence) and outcome (reef fish diversity)), we first want to check that our model is not violating the following structural model assumptions: the residuals are normally distributed and homoskedastic. If these assumptions are violated the effect size estimates are likely to be biased.

```{r,fig.width=2.7,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
# check our structural model assumptions
qqnorm(resid(mod)) # normality of residuals
qqline(resid(mod))
```

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
plot(mod) # residuals against fitted values - don't want to see any strong patterns
```

These diagnostic plots suggest our model is mis-specified, our residuals are not normally distributed or homoskedastic as we had assumed.

So, instead we need to fit a **generalised** linear model that doesn't assume the residual error is normally distributed.

### Fitting a correctly specified model

There are many different types of error distributions we can choose from, depending on the type of data we are modelling. In our case, we have a discrete outcome variable that is bounded to be 0 or greater. The poisson distribution with a log link function is a good option for describing discrete, positive data (the log link ensures our counts are positive only).

Sometimes visualising these abstract concepts helps us to understand them. Like we did before for the normal distribution, let's draw 1000 random numbers from the poisson distribution and plot them up.

Unlike the normal distribution, the poisson only has one parameter called lambda ($\lambda$) - it describes both the mean and the variance of the data (and therefore assumes they are equal).

```{r,fig.width=3,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
# draw random number form a poisson distribution
random_numbers_poisson <- rpois(n = 1000, lambda = 1)

# plot a histogram of the random poisson distribution
random_numbers_poisson <- data.frame(poisson_random_numbers = rpois(n = 1000, lambda = 1))

# plot a histogram of the distribution of normally distributed random numbers
random_numbers_poisson |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = poisson_random_numbers) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic()
```

Let's try fitting the model.

```{r,fig.width=2.7,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
# fit with a poisson distribution
mod2 <- glmer(fish_diversity ~ MPA_present + Port_distance_m + Habitat_Depth + (1|site.code), data = dat, family = poisson(link = "log")) 

# check structural model assumptions
qqnorm(resid(mod2))
qqline(resid(mod2)) 
```

```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center'}
plot(mod2)
```

Much better. Given our model no longer violates any assumptions, we can be more confident inferring the effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity from it.

## What is the effect of MPAs on fish diversity?

On average, MPAs in NSW have resulted in \~3 more species of fish

```{r}
# extract model beta coefficients (intercept and effect sizes (slopes))
mod2_coefs <- data.frame(Coefficient = row.names(summary(mod2)$coefficients), summary(mod2)$coefficients)

# extract the average predicted reef fish diversity inside and outside MPAs predicted by our model
# Note we take the exponent of the effect size estimate to back transform to the natural (rather than log scale)
mpa_diversity <- exp(filter(mod2_coefs, Coefficient == '(Intercept)')$Estimate + filter(mod2_coefs, Coefficient == 'MPA_present1')$Estimate)
no_mpa_diversity <- exp(filter(mod2_coefs, Coefficient == '(Intercept)')$Estimate)

# subtract diversity inside and outside MPAS
mpa_diversity - no_mpa_diversity
```

## Summary

Here we learned how to use a graphical causal model and a statistical regression model to estimate the causal effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity observations in New South Wales.

Being able to accurately quantify the effects of conservation is incredibly important for demonstrating success, which can bolster enthusiasm and funding for continued conservation action into the future.
