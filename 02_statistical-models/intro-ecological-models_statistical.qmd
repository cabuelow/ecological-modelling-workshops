## Quantifying conservation effectiveness

Marine protected areas are an important tool for conserving species. In contrast to last weeks workshop where we used a mathematical model to predict the future for endangered sea turtles, we'll look to the past and use models to quantify the effect that conservation has had on fish diversity.

### Have marine protected areas in New South Wales increased reef fish diversity, as we would expect?

There are a lot of different things that could influence fish diversity on reefs. A [recent paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718316525) has highlighted the challenges of isolating the impact of MPAs in the Great Barrier Reef.

![Theory of change for MPAs in the GBR - Fraser et al. 2019](images/toc.png)

Given all of the potential confounders, how can we isolate the effect of MPAs?

Here we'll combine a graphical modelling technique with a statistical model to isolate the effect of MPAs from observed diversity of reef fishes. 

## Structural (graphical) causal model

Structural causal models are graphical depictions of 'cause-and-effect' relationships in our system of interest which, in this case, is reef fish communities and marine protected areas (MPAs). Technically, these are called 'Directed Acyclic Graphs' (DAGs). **Acyclic** means we can't have any bi-directional relationships.

### Draw the DAG

The relationship we're interested in estimating is the causal effect of MPAs on reef fish species diversity. Let's draw a DAG for it.

```{r}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse) 
library(dagitty) 
library(ggdag)

# DAG of cause and effect relationship between MPAs and reef fish diversity
dag <- dagify(diversity ~ MPA,
              exposure = 'MPA',
              outcome = 'diversity')

# plot it
ggdag(dag, layout = "circle", text_size = 2) + theme_dag_blank()
```

What else might influence both the presence of MPAs and fish diversity? Let's add them to the DAG.

```{r}
# further develop the DAG
dag <- dagify(diversity ~ MPA, 
              diversity ~ MPA_dist, 
              diversity ~ latitude, 
              diversity ~ Port_dist, 
              diversity ~ depth, 
              diversity ~ fishing, 
              diversity ~ habitat, 
              fishing ~ MPA, 
              fishing ~ Port_dist, 
              MPA ~ Port_dist, 
              habitat ~ depth, 
              habitat ~ latitude, 
              fishing ~ MPA_dist, 
              MPA ~ depth, 
              MPA ~ habitat, 
              fishing ~ habitat, 
              fishing ~ depth, 
              exposure = 'MPA', 
              outcome = 'diversity')

# plot it
ggdag(dag, layout = "circle", text_size = 2) + theme_dag_blank()
```

### Find confounders to adjust for

Apply 'do-calculus' to the DAG to identify confounders that need to be adjusted for to estimate the causal effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity.

```{r}
ggdag_adjustment_set(dag, text_size = 2) + theme_dag_blank()
```

This says that habitat type, depth and distance to ports are confounders we need to adjust for in our **statistical regression model** that we use to estimate the effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity.

Statistical regression models allow us to quantify relationships between variables of interest, such as MPAs and reef fish diversity, assuming that all other variables (i.e., the confounders) are held constant.

Before we can run the statistical model though, we need to get some data (or we could simulate it first, which is best practice, but that's beyond the scope of this course).

## Data for our statistical model

To estimate the effect of MPAs on reef fish diversity we need data on the following:

1. MPAs in New South Wales (our exposure variable of interest)
2. Reef fish diversity inside and outside of MPAs in New South Wales (our outcome variable of interest)
3. Distance to ports from each of our reef fish diversity observations
4. Habitat type of each our reef fish diversity observations
5. Depth of each of our reef fish diversity observations.

### Marine protected areas (MPAs) in New South Wales

```{r}
# load libraries
library(wdpar)
library(sf) 
library(tmap)

# get protected area data
#pa_aus <- wdpa_fetch("Australia", wait = TRUE, download_dir = rappdirs::user_data_dir("wdpar")) 
#mpa_aus <- pa_aus |>  
  # filter out terrestrial mpas filter
 # filter(MARINE != "0") |> 
  # clean data 
  #wdpa_clean() 
#st_write(mpa_aus, '02_statistical-models/data/mpa_aus.gpkg')
mpa_aus <- st_read('02_statistical-models/data/mpa_aus.gpkg')

# map it
sf_use_s2(FALSE) # turn off s2 to avoid issues with mapping invalid geometries 
tmap_mode('view') 
mpa_aus |> qtm(fill = 'NO_TAKE')
```

### Fish diversity in New South Wales

```{r}
# read in fish data

fish_dat <- read.csv('02_statistical-models/data/rls_surveydata.csv') |>  
  filter(indicator == 'Fish Species' & location != 'Cape Howe') 

head(fish_dat) # turn into a spatial dataframe 
fish_dat_sf <- st_as_sf(fish_dat, coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'), crs = 4326) |>  
  st_transform(st_crs(mpa_aus)) 
qtm(fish_dat_sf)

# keep PAs that intersect with fish data

mpa_nsw <- st_join(mpa_aus, fish_dat_sf, left = F) |> 
  select(WDPAID:geometry) |> 
  group_by(WDPAID, NAME) |>  
  summarise() 
qtm(mpa_nsw)

# join MPA info to fish survey data

fish_dat_mpa <- fish_dat_sf |>  
  st_join(filter(mpa_aus, WDPAID %in% mpa_nsw$WDPAID))

# colour fish survey points whether in an mpa or not

qtm(mpa_nsw) + qtm(fish_dat_mpa, dots.col = 'PA_DEF') 
# how many? 
nrow(filter(fish_dat_mpa, PA_DEF == 'PA'))/nrow(fish_dat_mpa)
```

### Data on counfounders

```{r}
# get shortest distance of each survey point to a port

port_dat <- read.csv('02_statistical-models/data/nsw-ports.csv') |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c('long', 'lat'), crs = 4326) |>  
  st_transform(st_crs(mpa_nsw)) 
qtm(port_dat) 

port_dist <- fish_dat_mpa |> 
  st_distance(port_dat) 
colnames(port_dist) <- port_dat$name 
port_dist2 <- data.frame(st_drop_geometry(fish_dat_mpa), units::drop_units(port_dist)) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Yamba:Eden), names_to = 'Port_name', values_to = 'Port_distance_m') |> 
  group_by(survey.id) |> 
  summarise(Port_distance_m = min(Port_distance_m))

# join to master dataframe

fish_dat_mpa <- fish_dat_mpa |> 
  left_join(port_dist2) 
head(fish_dat_mpa)

# read in habitat and depth spatial data

habitat_dat <- st_read('02_statistical-models/data/Seabed_habitat_New_South_Wales_State_Waters/SeamapAus_NSW_seabed_habitat_statewide_2013Polygon.shp') |> 
  st_transform(st_crs(mpa_nsw))

# spatial join

fish_dat_mpa <- fish_dat_mpa |> 
  st_join(habitat_dat) 
head(fish_dat_mpa) # assign anything with NAs as non-reef and 0 - 20m depth 
fish_dat_mpa <- fish_dat_mpa |> 
  mutate(Habitat = ifelse(is.na(Habitat), 'Non-Reef', Habitat), Depth = ifelse(is.na(Depth), '0 - 20m', Depth)) 
write.csv(st_drop_geometry(fish_dat_mpa), '02_statistical-models/data/master-data.csv', row.names = F)
```

### Statistical model to isolate and quantify the effect of MPAs

```{r}
# fit statistical model to estimate causal effect of MPA on fish diversity

library(lme4)
dat <- read.csv('02_statistical-models/data/master-data.csv') |> 
  # dummy code binary variables 
  # make categorical variables factors 
  mutate(MPA_present = factor(ifelse(is.na(PA_DEF), 0, 1)), Habitat_Depth = factor(ifelse(is.na(Label), 'Non Reef 0 - 20m', Label)), 
         site.code = factor(site.code), fish_diversity = value, Port_distance_m = Port_distance_m/(2*sd(Port_distance_m)))
summary(dat)

# what do the raw data tell us?

ggplot(dat) + 
  aes(x = MPA_present, y = fish_diversity) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) + theme_classic()

# run model
library(lme4)
mod <- lmer(fish_diversity ~ MPA_present + Port_distance_m + Habitat_Depth + (1|site.code), data = dat) 
summary(mod)

# check our structural model assumptions

qqnorm(resid(mod)) 
qqline(resid(mod)) 
plot(mod)

# try a different family/distribution

mod2 <- glmer(fish_diversity ~ MPA_present + Port_distance_m + Habitat_Depth + (1|site.code), data = dat, family = poisson(link = "log")) 
summary(mod2) 
qqnorm(resid(mod2)) 
qqline(resid(mod2)) 
plot(mod2)

# what is the effect of MPAs on fish diversity?

mod2_coefs <- data.frame(Coefficient = row.names(summary(mod2)$coefficients),
                          summary(mod2)$coefficients) 
head(mod2_coefs) 
exp(filter(mod2_coefs, Coefficient == 'MPA_present1')$Estimate)

# fish diversity on average is predicted to be

exp(filter(mod2_coefs, Coefficient == '(Intercept)')$Estimate + filter(mod2_coefs, Coefficient == 'MPA_present1')$Estimate) # in MPAS, compared to outside MPAs, exp(filter(mod2_coefs, Coefficient == '(Intercept)')\$Estimate)

# So, MPAs are increasing fish diversity on average by \~ 3 species
#This is the estimated Poisson regression coefficient comparing mpas to non mpa areas, given the other #variables are held constant in the model

# do a plot of the results....
```
